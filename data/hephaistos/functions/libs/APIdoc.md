# Introducing
### Using custom crafts on the altar
Hephaistos Rituals is a new craft system that give you possibility to adds your own crafts on it. Alone it's useless but combined with others datapack from official or non-official Hephaistos suits, it become fitting for RP adventures.

You can also just offer to players to have a new way to crafts the custom items you developed. Having the crafts files without Hephaistos isn't a problem ! If you wants, you can also just add compatibility for the players !

### Benefits of Using the Hephaitsos' altar
The altar is used to craft items with 9 items - like in a crafting table - but you have the opportunity in addition to having very cool animations and a magical manufacturing method, to craft items with NBTs; YES ! It's NBT crafting time ! (So you can finally craft a custom book with instructions or commands in it)

### Structure of a craft
Each of them are identified by two factors. The first is the namespace. We preconize to use the default namespace of your datapack but you can also choose a new one.

Secondly each craft **must** have a unique id in their namespace. So you can't have two crafts named `namespace:example` but you can have an other craft named "example" in an other namespace.

So a craft would have this IDs :
```md
# ID : myItem
# namespace : testNamespace
# complete ID : myItem:testNamespace
```



# Add a craft
