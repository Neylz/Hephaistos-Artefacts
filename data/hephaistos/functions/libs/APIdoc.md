# Introducing
### Using custom crafts on the altar
Hephaistos Rituals is a new craft system that give you possibility to adds your own crafts on it. Alone it's useless but combined with others datapack from official or non-official Hephaistos suits, it become fitting for RP adventures.

You can also just offer to players to have a new way to crafts the custom items you developed. Having the crafts files without Hephaistos isn't a problem ! If you wants, you can also just add compatibility for the players !

### Benefits of Using the Hephaistos' altar
The altar is used to craft items with 9 items - like in a crafting table - but you have the opportunity in addition to having very cool animations and a magical manufacturing method, to craft items with NBTs; YES ! It's NBT crafting time ! (So you can finally craft a custom book with instructions or commands in it)

### Structure of a craft
Each of them are identified by two factors. The first is the namespace. We preconize to use the default namespace of your datapack but you can also choose a new one.

Secondly each craft **must** have a unique id in their namespace. So you can't have two crafts named `namespace:example` but you can have an other craft named "example" in an other namespace.

So a craft would have this IDs :
```md
# ID : myItem
# namespace : testNamespace
# complete ID : myItem:testNamespace
```



# Implements new crafts
## Global Strucure
Here is an exemple of strucure for your datapack; after adding the crafts you can add your own features.
```
root/
    data/
        <namespace>/
            functions/
                hscrafts/
                    tick.mcfunction
                    recipes.list.mcfunction
                    recipes/
                        <recipe1>.mcfunction
                        <recipe2>.mcfunction
                        <recipe3>.mcfunction
        
        minecraft/
            tags/
                functions/
                    tick.json

pack.mcmeta
```

## Tick function
The tick fuction is used to detect when an altar need to run the functions of your crafts.

So in `root/data/minecraft/tags/functions/tick`, insert the path of `call.mcfunction`. Here in our exemple it will looks like this:
```json
{
    "values": [
        "<namespace>:hscrafts/tick"
    ]
}
```

Inside the `tick.mcfunction`, you can just copy and past this code, replacing \<YOURNAMESPACE> by the name of your namespace. It will be used as fake players and scoreboards names.

âš  Set this to the namespace name of your datapack if you don't know precisely what you are doing.

```mcfunction
# crafts namespace : <YOURNAMESPACE>

# import
execute if score loadingCrafts hs_data matches 1 unless score <YOURNAMESPACE> hs_namespaceLoaded matches 1 run function <YOURNAMESPACE>:crafting/recipes.list
execute if score loadingCrafts hs_data matches 1 unless score <YOURNAMESPACE> hs_namespaceLoaded matches 1 run scoreboard players set <YOURNAMESPACE> hs_namespaceLoaded 1


execute if score craftingOnAltar hs_data matches 0.. unless score <YOURNAMESPACE> hs_crafting_namesapceCheked matches 1 run execute as @e[type=marker,nbt={data:{ha:{altar_center:1b}}}] at @s if score @s hs_altarId = craftingOnAltar hs_data run function <YOURNAMESPACE>:crafting/recipes.list
scoreboard players set <YOURNAMESPACE> hs_crafting_namesapceCheked 1
```

## Recipes.list function

In Global Structure section as the name of `recipes.list.mcfuntion`, in it you will put all the recipes function (animations of the crafts not included).
So if you want to temporary delete a recipe for testing/other reasons, you can just delete the line calling the recipe's function without delete the files or more code.


If you want to add a new craft you just need to add a command like in that :
```mcfunction
execute as @s at @s run function <ressource location>
```

So in the Global Strucure exemple if all the crafts are loaded, `recipes.list.mcfunction` will looks like this :

```mcfunction
# list of all crafts loaded
# delete here the function line of a specific craft to temporary disable it

execute as @s at @s run function <namespace>:crafting/recipes/helpbook
```

Here again, you will have to change \<namespace> by the name you used as namespace.


## Add a new craft

Here we are ! We have now all the necessary structure to add all crafts we want !
